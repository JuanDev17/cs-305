# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial services company aiming to offer customized financial plans for consumers. Wanting to incorporate robust security. My role was to improve their security. 


# What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

I successfully used dependency testing to identify vulnerabilities. Secure coding practices are essential. It reduces the risk of exposing weak points that hackers can potentially exploit.


# Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

For me, the hardest was identifying false positives in the vulnerability scan results. 


# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

To increased security, I implemented a SSL certificate to enable encrypted communication. Ensuring the application used secure HTTP POST requests. 


# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?


I ran the application multiple times and used dependency checks to validate both functionality and security.


# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Using automated vulnerability scanning tools and following secure coding guidelines will also be valuable for future projects.


# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?


I would present my vulnerability assessment report, as it demonstrates my ability to identify and address security risks in a real world.
